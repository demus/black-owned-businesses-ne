# black-owned-businesses-ne

Hi! This project contains the source code of a web scraper for business location data, and the result of running the scraper on a dataset of black owned businesses in New England.
I, like many of you, have seen lists of [black owned businesses circulating the internet](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/black-owned-restaurant-lists), and thought it would be useful to visualize nearby businesses on a map.
It turns out that GitHub supports [rendering GeoJSON](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/mapping-geojson-files-on-github) files so as a first step I am embedding GitHub's GeoJSON render of this data on GitHub pages.
